Project Overview

This project was completed as part of BTEC IT Unit 6: Website Development. The aim was to design, develop, test, and evaluate a multi-page website based on a client scenario. The client, Hot Beans Web, required a new website section to support the recruitment of trainee web developers.

The website was planned using a structured development process. Client requirements were gathered using the SQIRO method, followed by the creation of design ideas, wireframes, storyboards, and a site map. The final design was chosen based on client feedback and target audience needs.

The completed website includes multiple pages such as a homepage, company profile, employee profiles, careers and job vacancies, useful links, and an online application form. The site was designed to be clear, easy to navigate, and suitable for new and aspiring web developers.

What I Learned:

This project helped me develop practical skills in website planning, front-end development, testing, documentation, and evaluation. It also improved my understanding of working to client requirements, usability considerations, and iterative improvement, which are directly relevant to an IT or software development apprenticeship.
